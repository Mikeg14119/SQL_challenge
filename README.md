# SQL_challenge
Executive Summary

This assignment provided us with a set of tables relating to a company “Pewlett Hackard” and its employment information from the 1980’s and 1990’s. This information containe departments, employee names, birth dates, sex, titles, and hire dates. 


Introduction


This assignment is a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files from which we will pull the available data. 


Data Collection, Preparation, Exploration, and Cleaning


The data for this analysis was provided in CSV format and was imported into PostgreSQL. One challenge encountered during data preparation was ensuring that all columns had consistent data types and formats. This was addressed by using appropriate data types for each column during the import process. EDA was performed to understand the characteristics of the data, including identifying missing values, outliers, and any patterns or relationships between variables.


Data Analysis


SQL queries were used to perform the data analysis, including selecting specific columns, filtering data based on certain criteria, joining tables, and using functions such as COUNT() and SUM(). The results of the analysis revealed insights into employee demographics, hiring trends, and departmental information.




Conclusion


This assignment provided an opportunity to work with PostgreSQL, PGAdmin, and SQL queries. By completing this assignment, I have gained a better understanding of how to create a database schema, import data from CSV files, and retrieve specific data using SQL queries. The analysis of employee data using SQL has provided valuable insights into employee demographics, hiring trends, and departmental information. The results of the analysis can be used to optimize recruitment and retention strategies, identify skill gaps, and develop career paths for employees. However, limitations of the analysis include the limited scope of the data and the potential for errors or biases in the data. Future work could include expanding the analysis to include more variables or data sources, and using statistical models to further analyze the data.
